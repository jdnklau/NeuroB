# To Do List
- relook into training set generation
  - optimise
  - take stuff out that is no longer needed
  - make sure all exceptions are properly handled
    - take unchecked exceptions into account: ProB errors and stuff
    - decide between bad predicates and bad files
- training set generation and analysis of the set should inspect the labellings differently
  - perhaps a list of how often an individual labelling was used instead of only checking if the outputs are all the same or not
  - allow a deeper analysis
    - e.g. list predicates with the same features but different labellings
- Test cases for training data generation
  - small example files should suffice
  - think about solution to compare Code Portfolios
- update cli
  - iterate about some options, like single training file generation and if this is still necessary
  - change handling in Cli of neural nets
    - allow to give custom seed(s) for RNG
    - training multiple nets with different seeds should create the next net after the previous one has finished training
- update java doc
