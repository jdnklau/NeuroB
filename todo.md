# Necessary refactoring steps
- convolutional training set
    - simply put file names as img{id}_{labelling}.gif
- training set generator
    - split training data method (more generic version of split csv)
- rename PredicateDump and similar classes and phrasings to NBTrain

# To Do List
- ~~random predicate generator~~
    - ~~tool to insert formal grammar and generate an amount of correct syntax snippets~~
- find and read papers
    - rnn for code/text classification
- model handling
    - have list of preprocessing utilities that is managed by responsible class
- training
    - calculate training error thus far
        - after X iterations rather than just after each epoch
    - save trained models to disk by default
    - more generic handling of data preprocessing if possible
        - add more preprocessing tools
            - PCA: whitening, feature reduction
    - more output for evaluation
        - log confusion matrix
        - distinction between classification and regression
- training set generation
    - add function to truncate data.csv to contain all classes more evenly
    - model check machines
        - generate 100 states per solver
        - give credit to fastest one
        - future work?
    - shuffle data files
    - optimise
    - data augmentation for larger training sets
    - ~~store training data in binary option, instead of csv or directory hierarchy~~
- training set analysis
    - add fancy stuff for classification
        - t-SNE
        - PCA
- update java doc
