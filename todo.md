# To Do List
- random predicate generator
    - tool to insert formal grammar and generate an amount of correct syntax snippets
- find and read papers
    - rnn for code/text classification
- model handling
    - have list of preprocessing utilities that is managed by responsible class
- training
    - calculate training error thus far
        - after X iterations rather than just after each epoch
    - save files to disk by default
    - more generic handling of data preprocessing if possible
- training set generation
    - model check machines
        - generate 100 states per solver
        - give credit to fastest one
    - optimise
    - data augmentation for larger training sets
        - access/generate proof obligations
    - more distinct support for convolutional models
    - code images
        - ~~translating image directory back to csv~~
    - store training data in binary option, instead of csv or directory hierarchy
        - this means hand crafted data pipeline
        - benefits:
            - images as binary objects rather than their feature string representation
            - still regression is part of the deal as no directory hierarchy is necessary but only the data pack
- training set analysis
    - add fancy stuff for classification
        - t-SNE
        - PCA
- update java doc
