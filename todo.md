# To Do List

- SolverClassificationGenerator should only allow for one solver to check for in future
    - thus it will never be a regression problem
    - regression variant can take timeouts into account
- training
    - logging
    - calculate training error thus far
        - after X iterations rather than just after each epoch
    - save files to disk by default
    - more generic handling of data preprocessing if possible
- training set generation
    - also use EventB machines
    - also use private examples
    - model check machines
        - generate 100 states per solver
        - give credit to fastest one
    - optimise
    - ~add formulae wrapper, allowing for easier manipulation of them~
        - ~idea is to have a FormulaCollection object (or similar), e.g. called f, that allows wraps internally an array list of strings/ASTs~
        - ~one may then call f.manipulationOfAST1().manipulationOfAST2()~
        - ~decide whether it should simply manipulate the already present formulae or add the manipulated results to them (aka augment present data vs. augment copy of present data and keep both)~
        - ~maybe just allow methods and other classes to operate on such an element, but offer not much functionality on its own?~
            - to many wrapper abstractions
    - data augmentation for larger training sets
        - throw in some equivalences in the extended guard formulae, to step up hardness of decidability
        - drop randomly (30% chance?) basic nodes in ast
        - access/generate proof obligations
    - more distinct support for convolutional models
- training set analysis should be deeper
    - offer fancy stuff like PCA
    - code portfolios
        - ~~translating image directory back to csv~~
        - zip images to big binary rather than csv or directory hierarchy
            - this means hand crafted data pipeline
            - benefits:
                - images as binary objects rather than their feature string representation
                - still regression is part of the deal as no directory hierarchy is necessary but only the data pack
    - analyse regression
        - get min and max value for each label generated
        - get mean, std dev, median
        - basically some box plot values
- update cli
    - iterate about some options, like single training file generation and if this is still necessary
- update java doc
