# To Do List
- add visualisations for network training
- SolverClassificationGenerator should only allow for one solver to check for in future
    - thus it will never be a regression problem
    - regression variant can take timeouts into account
- revisit training set generation
    - optimise
    - take stuff out that is no longer needed
- training set analysis should be deeper
    - offer fancy stuff like PCA
- Test cases for training data generation
    - small example files should suffice
    - think about solution to compare Code Portfolios
- update cli
    - iterate about some options, like single training file generation and if this is still necessary
    - change handling in Cli of neural nets
        - allow to give custom seed(s) for RNG
- update java doc
