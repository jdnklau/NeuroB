# To Do List
- random predicate generator
    - tool to insert formal grammar and generate an amount of correct syntax snippets
- find and read papers
    - rnn for code/text classification
- model handling
    - have list of preprocessing utilities that is managed by responsible class
- training
    - calculate training error thus far
        - after X iterations rather than just after each epoch
    - save files to disk by default
    - more generic handling of data preprocessing if possible
- training set generation
    - introduce predicate dumps
        - files containing all predicates generateable by NeuroB with possible labelling
        - labellings include: 
            - can ProB decide it? In which time can ProB decide it?
            - can KodKod decide it? In which time can KodKod decide it?
            - can ProB+Z3 decide it? In which time can ProB+Z3 decide it?
        - labelling format is <solver decidability classification>,<solver time> for each solver
            - new solvers at end, should be downwards compatible
    - make sure to distinguish properly between ClassicalB and EventB commands
    - add function to truncate data.csv to contain all classes more evenly
    - model check machines
        - generate 100 states per solver
        - give credit to fastest one
    - optimise
    - data augmentation for larger training sets
        - access/generate proof obligations
    - more distinct support for convolutional models
    - code images
        - ~~translating image directory back to csv~~
    - store training data in binary option, instead of csv or directory hierarchy
        - this means hand crafted data pipeline
        - benefits:
            - images as binary objects rather than their feature string representation
            - still regression is part of the deal as no directory hierarchy is necessary but only the data pack
- training set analysis
    - add fancy stuff for classification
        - t-SNE
        - PCA
- update java doc
