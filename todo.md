# To Do List

- SolverClassificationGenerator should only allow for one solver to check for in future
    - thus it will never be a regression problem
    - regression variant can take timeouts into account
- training
    - logging
    - recape time elapsed after each epoch or X iterations
        - maybe calculate ETA
    - calculate training error thus far
    - visualisation
    - save files to disk by default? 
        - sounds reasonable as it allows to directly access the corresponding network
- training set generation
    - optimise maybe
    - take stuff out that is no longer needed
    - add formulae wrapper, allowing for easier manipulation of them
        - idea is to have a FormulaCollection object (or similar), e.g. called f, that allows wraps internally an array list of strings/ASTs
        - one may then call f.manipulationOfAST1().manipulationOfAST2()
        - decide whether it should simply manipulate the already present formulae or add the manipulated results to them (aka augment present data vs. augment copy of present data and keep both)
        - maybe just allow methods and other classes to operate on such an element, but offer not much functionality on its own?
            - could result in to many wrapper abstractions...
    - think about data augmentation for larger training sets
        - will deleting nodes in AST that simply state integer domains for variables result in translation errors on the prob side or does it just make stuff harder to decide?
        - throw in some equivalences in the extended guard formulae, to step up hardness of decidability
    - more support for convolutional stuff: training set of convolutional features should default to the matching directory hierarchy
        - or should it?
    - alternative version of predicate features that behaves binary
        - instead of counting how often something is, simply value it as 0 or 1
        - compare with predicate features whether this changes results drastically to the worse
- training set analysis should be deeper
    - offer fancy stuff like PCA
    - translate data csv of code portfolios to data structure with actual images
        - and also translating it back
        - what is the structure for regression?
        - maybe simply use binary packages?
            - read myself into dl4j data pipelines
- Test cases for training data generation
    - small example files should suffice
    - think about solution to compare Code Portfolios
- update cli
    - iterate about some options, like single training file generation and if this is still necessary
    - change handling in Cli of neural nets
        - allow to give custom seed(s) for RNG
- update java doc
