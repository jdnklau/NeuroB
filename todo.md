# To Do List
- add visualisations for network training
- revisit training set generation
    - optimise
    - allow splitting of csv files on demand, do not split as part of general training set generation
        - instead, user shall split train, validation, and test set himself
    - take stuff out that is no longer needed
    - make sure all exceptions are properly handled
        - take unchecked exceptions into account: ProB errors and stuff
        - decide between bad predicates and bad files
- training set analysis should be deeper
    - maybe extrapolate the labels unused? e.g. state if SolverPrediction data never targets 1,1,0 e.g.
    - offer fancy stuff like PCA
- Test cases for training data generation
    - small example files should suffice
    - think about solution to compare Code Portfolios
- update cli
    - iterate about some options, like single training file generation and if this is still necessary
    - change handling in Cli of neural nets
        - allow to give custom seed(s) for RNG
        - training multiple nets with different seeds should create the next net after the previous one has finished training
- update java doc
